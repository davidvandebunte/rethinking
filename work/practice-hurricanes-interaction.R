**12H3.** In the data, there are two measures of a hurricaneâ€™s potential to cause death:
`damage_norm` and `min_pressure`. Consult `?Hurricanes` for their meanings. It makes some sense to
imagine that femininity of a name matters more when the hurricane is itself deadly. This implies an
interaction between femininity and either or both of `damage_norm` and `min_pressure`. Fit a series
of models evaluating these interactions. Interpret and compare the models. In interpreting the
estimates, it may help to generate counterfactual predictions contrasting hurricanes with masculine
and feminine names. Are the effect sizes plausible?

In the second model, lets assume an interaction between `femininity` and `min_pressure`. Pressure is

There also appears to be a minor interaction between pressure and femininity, though now the
association is in the opposite direction. That is, when both pressure and femininity are positive,
which means the storm is weak and feminine, more deaths occur.

[ept]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyptych

To some extent this is a counterfactual plot rather than just a posterior prediction plot because
we're considering extremes of at least some predictors. Still, many of the predictors vary here only
within the range of the data.

In the following [Enneaptych][ept], we hold damage and pressure at typical values and vary
femininity. We observe the effect on deaths. Many of the effect sizes are inplausible. In the
bottom-right plot, notice an implication of the non-negative three-way interaction parameter: when
pressure is high and damage is low femininity has a dramatic effect on deaths.
