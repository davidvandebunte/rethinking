**11H4.** The data contained in `data(salamanders)` are counts of salamanders (*Plethodon
elongatus*) from 47 different 49-mÂ² plots in northern California. The column `SALAMAN` is the count in
each plot, and the columns `PCTCOVER` and `FORESTAGE` are percent of [ground cover][gc] and age of trees
in the plot, respectively. You will model `SALAMAN` as a Poisson variable.

(a) Model the relationship between density and percent cover, using a log-link (same as the example
in the book and lecture). Use weakly informative priors of your choosing. Check the quadratic
approximation again, by comparing `quap` to `ulam`. Then plot the expected counts and their 89%
interval against percent cover. In which ways does the model do a good job? In which ways does it do
a bad job?

The model does well (is more certain) when it needs to guess lower numbers; when there are fewer
salamanders when the ground cover is low. In general, though, it is uncertain about most of its
predictions.

display_markdown("
(b) Can you improve the model by using the other predictor, `FORESTAGE`? Try any models you think
useful. Can you explain why `FORESTAGE` helps or does not help with prediction?

**Answer.** It doesn't seem forest age helps much with prediction; it may be that forest age only
predicts ground cover and so adds no extra information.
