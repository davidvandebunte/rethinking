**9H5.** Modify the Metropolis algorithm code from the chapter to handle the case that the island
populations have a different distribution than the island labels. This means the islandâ€™s number
will not be the same as its population.

**Answer.** The new island populations are proportional to:

```R
island_pop_prop = sqrt(island_number)
```
