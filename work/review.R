# Summary

[err]: https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking/blob/master/ERRATA.md
[iss]: https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking/issues

There are a *lot* of typos and errors in the second edition. Take the attitude of ignoring these
early on or finding a way to only mark them for your own sake. In the more detailed review below, you
will see obvious errors marked with **ERROR**. This list is largely incomplete; it misses many minor
errors (i.e. typos) later in the book as they become too tiresome to collect. If you don't believe
me, see all the unresolved [open issues][iss] in the author's GitHub repository.

The [ERRATA][err] is empty because (of course) GitHub issues are not being addressed. The absolute
number of errors is probably also part of the problem. This is a shame because even an incomplete
errata makes reading a book easier; you should often keep an errata open when you read a textbook to
avoid puzzling over an issue someone else has already identified and explained. If a book doesn't
have an errata, either the author never makes mistakes or they don't have the time.

## VitalSource

[vs]: https://www.vitalsource.com/

The ebook format ([VitalSource][vs]) is quite limited. The VitalSource pages are painfully slow to
load; I would load several chapters in different tabs at once (in Firefox, use `Alt-D` then
`Alt-Enter` to duplicate a tab). You'll need a tab for global search in the book as well.

The VitalSource format doesn't display page numbers well and can only be navigated with a mouse
(unlike an HTML page). Some errors only appear in the VitalSource and not in the pbook (printed
book). If you're reading the VitalSource (as you must if you want to use a digital copy) then you're
also going to need to get used to its rendering of equations, which is horrendous (see e.g. section
**4.4.1** or **12.3.2**).

In my experience, it was best to 'Reset to Publisher Format' and use my browser to change the text
size.

Other publishers (like MAA) provide you with a PDF that is clearly marked with your name to prevent
distribution. You can find one bootlegged pdf version of Statistical Rethinking Ed. 2 (SR2) online
(from Dec. 2019), missing significant content and with even more errors. The author has apparently
offered online courses in the past to get a pdf.

## Strengths

[we]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worked-example_effect#Worked_example
[bda3]: http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/

The book is entertaining, which can make it easier to remember concepts. As advertised, it's driven
by many [Worked examples][we]. In general, it also focuses on the forest rather than the trees.
These are the primary ways it tries to distinguish itself from more standard textbooks on Bayesian
analysis such as [BDA3][bda3]. The author seems to be heavily influenced by Gelman, based on both
his references and how the book relies on Stan (developed by Gelman).

The chapter layouts, with **Rcode** text boxes interspersed, is similar to a Jupyter notebook but
without being directly executable. Unfortunately not being executable means the chapter code doesn't
actually run without a number of fixes. The advantage to this approach is users can work in a plain
text editor rather than a browser, but this doesn't in itself imply the code shouldn't be runnable.

# Personal Workflow

Start by getting models working with MCMC (`ulam`), which provides a lot more debugging information
and is capable of estimating non-Gaussian posteriors. Once you're happy with the results, check that
`quap` provides the same answer and switch to it so scripts run faster.

Prefer to `source` R files from the shell rather than running the publish script when you're
debugging issues. Many errors/warnings are swallowed by papermill.

### 2.3.2. Definitions

By far the most confusing definition given here is for the likelihood. In this book, a 'likelihood'
will refer to a distribution function assigned to an observed variable. In this section, for
example, the 'likelihood' is the binomial distribution. According to the author, this is the
language used in 'conventional' statistics as well. The author often calls this the 'likelihood' but
it is a function, of course, because any probability distribution is a function.

[lf]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function

In non-Bayesian statistics and in particular on Wikipedia the definition of the likelihood function
is completely different and denoted with $\mathcal{L}$. See the author's footnote and [Likelihood
function][lf].

## 4.5.1. Polynomial regression.

It is standard practice to **STANDARDIZE** variables but the explanation given here isn't
particularly helpful. Consider `scale` provided by the R language. When should you set `center` to
TRUE? When should you set `scale` to TRUE? The author's function `standardize` will show up without
explanation later in the book, but all it adds to `scale` (if you look at it) is a little type
coercion.

See also [Feature scaling][fs]. This article uses the terms 'normalization' and 'standardization' in
a way that almost match the author's `normalize` and `standardize` functions.

See also:
- [Normalization (statistics)][ns].
- [Understanding scale in R - SO][sr].

Perhaps one way to look at this is as providing priors to the machine about what is big and small,
though in theory it could figure it out from the data. In other cases, the model may make
assumptions about predictors being on the same scale. Is there a way to communicate bounds such as
that the numbers are percentages in question **11H4**?

You often run into failures to fit because variables are not standardized. For example, `quap` asks
for a starting point or `ulam` spits many warnings. In most of these cases, you aren't supplying
reasonable priors. It may be standardization is an easy way to get parameters on the same scale and
indirectly provide these priors in a simple way, without the work of doing a prior predictive
simulation. That is, could standardization be a way to avoid the work of supplying reasonable
priors?

The other advantage of standardization is you can look at `precis` output and compare parameter
values because all your parameters are about on the same scale. Are you preferring the convenience
of using a single parameter scale on this plot too much? You may also be avoiding posterior
predictive simulation, preferring to look at parameter values instead only because it's easier to
look at parameter values than work on the outcome scale.

### 6.3.1. Collider of false sorrow.

**ERROR:** See:
> This is just the categorical variable strategy from Chapter 4.

The categorical variable strategy is discussed in Section 5.3.

This section is naturally hard to understand, so here's an extra explanation for why conditioning on
marriage leads to a negative association between age and happiness. First, lets assume we know
you're married. If you're young, then it's quite likely you're happier than average because you got
married so young. If you're old, then it may only be time that led to you getting married. So in
summary, being older is a good indication you're unhappy (a negative association). Second, lets
assume we know you're unmarried. If you're young, then you may simply not have had enough time to
get married. If you're old and still unmarried, it's more likely you are an unhappy person and so
the time treatment didn't lead you to getting married. So in summary, being older is a good
indication you're unhappy (a negative association).

Said yet another way, consider Figure 6.4. From age 20 to 30, the average of the blue bubbles is
about 1. At age 60, the average of the blue bubbles is closer to zero. Now consider the white
bubbles. From 20 to 30, the average of the white bubbles is close to zero. At age 60, the average
is closer to -1.

### 7.2.3. From entropy to accuracy.

If we're going from Earth to Mars, we're an Earthling with certain priors (vice versa, a Martian).

From this perspective, by using a high entropy distribution to approximate an unknown true
distribution, we're less surprised by any particular observation because in general we don't expect
anything unlikely. The Earthling was from the higher entropy planet, and so wasn't as surprised by
travel.

When we use a higher entropy distribution we're potentially reducing the cross entropy by reducing
the $log(q_i)$ terms (in particular, the sum of the terms will definitely be reduced). We're not
guaranteed to reduce the cross entropy (and therefore the KL divergence) though, because by
increasing the entropy of $q$ we may be making it dissimilar to $p$ in a way that increases a term
where $p_i$ is large. Read question **7H3** for a numerical example.

The term of 'most of' should be removed, this is clearly a complete cancellation:
$$
D_{KL}(p,q) = H(p,q) - H(p) \\
D_{KL}(p,r) = H(p,r) - H(p) \\

> We'll work some examples using quap

For commentary on times you should not use `quap` see:

- The **Rethinking** box in section **2.4.4**

The typical network in deep learning will be based on MLE (i.e. `quap`). If you want to add another
predictor to this kind of network you need to ask whether you expect the posterior to be Gaussian or
you may struggle to get optimization (i.e. inference) to work. You also need to confirm your priors
are symmetric (see **11M7**) again so that optimization works. Because MCMC is much more time
expensive than MLE, you may not have a choice.

If you have the time, you can `compare` a `quap` and `ulam` fit to confirm `quap` is good enough. If
there is no difference in inference, then clearly it doesn't matter. Another major advantage of
`ulam` over `quap` is it will report errors when you're struggling to fit.

### 11.2.1. Example: Oceanic tool complexity.

**ERROR:** The subplot titles in Figure 11.8 are confused. In the bottom two subplots, the titles

It's not clear why **a** is not specified in the top two subplots; the plots are reproducible with

population and log population scales. The top right and bottom left subplots of Figure 11.8 should

Figure 11.8 actually produces is a different view of the prior on the standardized log population
scale. To understand this, consider this code to reproduce the bottom-left subplot. This code only
changes `xlim` and `ylim` in **R code 11.42** rather than switching to the more complicated approach
in **R code 11.43**:

```R
plot(NULL, xlim = c(5, 12), ylim = c(0, 500),
   main='Figure 11.8: Bottom-left subplot',
   xlab='log population', ylab='total tools')

The right plot above shows the same diminishing returns on population discussed in the text, even
though the curves now bend both ways. It's unfortunate the author chose to introduce this concept of
diminishing returns in the context of the Poisson model, as if there's something special about it,
e.g. that logging a predictor to a Poisson model is the only way to achieve diminishing returns. If
you log a predictor in a plain old linear regression, you'll achieve the same diminishing returns.
That is, the influence of the predictor on the outcome will decrease as x increases, just as the
instantaneous slope of the logarithm decreases as the argument increases in a graph of the
logarithm.

Introducing the idea of diminishing returns in the context of the Poisson distribution is also
confusing because its link function is already a logarithm. In fact, why doesn't the inverse link
(`exp`) undo the log in a logged predictor? Consider the model again, assuming the predictor is
logged:

$$
\begin{align}
y_i & = Poisson(\lambda) \\
log(\lambda) & = \alpha + \betaÂ·log(x)
\end{align}
$$

Applying the inverse link to $\lambda$:

$$
\begin{align}
\lambda & = exp(\alpha + \betaÂ·log(x)) \\
\lambda & = exp(\alpha) + exp(\betaÂ·log(x)) \\
\lambda & = exp(\alpha) + exp(log(x^{\beta})) \\
\lambda & = exp(\alpha) + x^{\beta}
\end{align}
$$

That is, this will only happen when $\beta$ is inferred to about equal one. The following plot
reproduces this situation. The code to produce this plot does not standardize `x` because doing so
would scale the logarithmic axis (based on the natural logarithm) by the standard deviation of the
data, making it harder to produce straight lines.
